# FP_Growth
Developed a ML Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm in Data Mining to get frequent item sets for the unsupervised  data sets and predicted the outcomes while implementing the algorithm on 21 datasets from UCI data repository.  Performed Experimental analysis on increasing the threshold to the number of frequent sets.
